## Three Evils

The **Three Evils** ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 三个势力; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 三個勢力; [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'three forces/influences') is a political slogan of the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China") defined as [terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism "Terrorism"), [separatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism "Separatism") (or "splittism") and [religious extremism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_extremism "Religious extremism"). The phrase refers to declared [counter-terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism "Counter-terrorism") operations undertaken by China, [Central Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia") republics, and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), primarily as related to [Xinjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang").[1](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-HR-1) [2](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-Li2019-2) The Chinese government views each of the Three Evils as interrelated phenomena driving persistent instability in the westernmost province of Xinjiang, and the slogan has been deployed extensively in support of [Xinjiang re-education camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps "Xinjiang re-education camps") since 2017.[3](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-Greitens_et_al._2020-3)

## History

Further information: [Xinjiang conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_conflict "Xinjiang conflict")

Xinjiang is the westernmost province of China and the historical home of the [Uyghur people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people "Uyghur people"), who speak a language unrelated to Chinese and predominantly practice Islam. The region has been the site of significant tensions under Chinese rule, and attempted to declare independence first as the short-lived [First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_East_Turkestan_Republic "First East Turkestan Republic") and [Second East Turkestan Republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_East_Turkestan_Republic "Second East Turkestan Republic") in 1933 and 1944, respectively, ultimately being occupied by the [People's Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army "People's Liberation Army") in 1949.[4](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-FOOTNOTELi2019320-4)

China first seriously faced issues of ethnic violence in Xinjiang beginning in the 1990s, such as with the 1990 [Baren Township riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baren_Township_riot "Baren Township riot"), though such incidents were generally classified as "social unrest" until after the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks"), when the government began to refer to them more in terms of terrorism.[5](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-FOOTNOTELi2019316%E2%80%93317-5) Much of the Uyghur discontent stemmed from economic inequality between Uyghurs and Han Chinese migrants, suppression of Uyghur religious practices, and state preference for Han over Uyghur culture, among other issues.[6](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-FOOTNOTELi2019325%E2%80%9327-6) Counterterrorism became a much larger Chinese government priority overall after the ascension of [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping") in 2012; following a lull from 2001-2007, militant and terrorist activity had increased notably.[7](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-FOOTNOTELi2019313-7)

## Criticisms

[Human Rights Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch") has criticized counter-terrorism cooperation by members of the [Shanghai Cooperation Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation") in targeting the three evils, accusing the members' governments of violating [international laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") regarding [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights").[1](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-HR-1) Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said, "For many years SCO governments have been criticized for their poor human rights records. The SCO's policies could worsen human rights conditions and seek to justify abuse. It's therefore imperative that the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") and the United States place even greater emphasis on human rights issues in the region."[1](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThree_Evils#cite_note-HR-1)
