## Transcript
I've had a few requests to cover gas
lighting on this channel and I think
it&#39;s a really great topic for a couple
of reasons one it&#39;s universal
all of us who have been in emotionally
abusive relationships have encountered
gas lighting on some level and two it&#39;s
very commonly confused because there are
a lot of things that go into gas
lighting and it&#39;s not one specific
action so in this video we&#39;re going to
explore what is gas lighting who uses
gas lighting and why they do it and then
we&#39;re gonna wrap it up with some tips to
help you start to overcome the gas
lighting that you&#39;ve experienced in your
relationships so if you&#39;re ready let&#39;s
jump in my name is Christina and on this
channel we explore narcissistic abuse
its connection with spirituality and we
attempt to answer the question where do
we go from here so if that all sounds

thank you and welcome back so what is
gas lighting it&#39;s kind of a funny term
for what it actually describes right if
you&#39;ve never heard the origins before
you&#39;re probably wondering where did that
even come from so it came from a 1938
play that was later made into a movie
the play was named Gaslight and it was
about a husband and wife the husband was
abusive and he was attempting to make
his wife look and feel crazy like she&#39;s
lost her mind
so a few of the things he would do is
you know he would hide things around the
house and there were times where he
would go up to the attic to rummage
around for valuable and while he did
this remember it&#39;s 1938 so he would turn
on a light and attic and like gas life
and the rest of the house would dim and
flicker and when the wife brought this
up he made her feel like she was crazy
like it wasn&#39;t actually happening she
saw it with her own eyes but he made her
question her sense of reality her own
perception of what was real and what
wasn&#39;t and so this is where the true gas
lighting comes from and it describes the
emotionally manipulative
Niq that people use to make you question
your own perception of reality and when
it&#39;s extreme it can make you question
your your own sense of sanity it&#39;s
incredibly devious and unfortunately
it&#39;s something that usually happens over
a long period of time it can be subtle
and it can be very overt in your face
and it&#39;s usually layered there are
usually many layers to the gas line and
all of these things contribute to to
make it unfortunately an effective
technique of keeping people under
control so who uses gas lighting most
often you&#39;re going to find that it is
narcissist sociopaths Psychopaths
cluster B personalities emotionally
abusive people but with that said just
because someone is gas lighting you
doesn&#39;t mean that they have a
personality disorder
anyone who&#39;s hiding something might use
some gas lighting techniques they might
make you try to question your perception
of reality because your perception of
reality is the truth that they don&#39;t
want you to see and that is why people
use gas lighting but it goes a little
bit deeper because the reason why they
don&#39;t want you to see reality is usually
because they want or need to keep you
under control so in the case of a
narcissist whose gas lighting let&#39;s say
you are their main source of supply they
don&#39;t want to lose you they have to keep
you on the hook so if they&#39;re lying
about something and you catch them in a
lie they&#39;re very likely to use gas
lighting techniques to make you question
your perception of reality so you go
into it knowing that they&#39;re lying you
go into it knowing that they&#39;ve told you
a lie but you walk out of it questioning
whether they&#39;re lying and wondering if
you can trust your own senses so how do
we identify a gas lighting when we speak
of it in the broad theft the definition
of gas lighting if you haven&#39;t
encountered it you might think well why
would anyone fall for that but in
reality when you&#39;re in these situations
when you&#39;re in an abusive relationship
and someone is gas lighting you it
be very confusing and it&#39;s meant to be
confusing so what is gas lighting and
what isn&#39;t gas lighting there are at
least four hallmark behaviors that are
present when you are in a situation
where somebody&#39;s trying to Gaslight you
and the first one is repeated lying so
you catch somebody in a lie and what do
they do to cover up instead of coming
clean they lie again and maybe they lie
again and the second sign goes hand in
hand with that denial of evidence you
may say well I saw you do this and you
may come back with no you didn&#39;t you
didn&#39;t see that that wasn&#39;t me or you
just you just don&#39;t know what you saw
you think you you didn&#39;t actually see it
and they come they may come back at you
with with supporting evidence - so we&#39;ll
remember this other time that you
thought you saw this thing and it wasn&#39;t
that thing well this could be like that
- and this is how over time gas lighting
can build at the very least it will eat
away at your confidence and and your
ability to trust yourself the third sign
of gas lighting is misdirection so
you&#39;re having a conversation about one
thing and the emotionally abusive person
that you&#39;re talking to changes the
subject and again this is one where you
would think well I would see that
happening but remember these people they
know better than anyone how to push your
buttons and there are a few ways that
they can use misdirection to get you
talking about something else one they
could do something that&#39;s kind of
related they can shift just a very
slight shift of the conversation so that
you&#39;re talking about something slightly
different but related or another way
they can use in this direction is by
bringing up something that they know
triggers you bringing up a conversation
that maybe you&#39;ve brought up a hundred
times before and they&#39;ve never really
wanted to discuss it so now&#39;s your
chance now they&#39;re bringing up this
other topic that they&#39;ve never wanted to
talk about before it&#39;s always been
off-limits suddenly suddenly it&#39;s okay
to talk
about as long as you&#39;re not talking
about this other thing so misdirection
you can think of kind of like a verbal
sleight of hand don&#39;t look over here
look over there and the board sign that
you are dealing with somebody who&#39;s
gaslighting you is contradiction they
will often contradict themselves in the
same discussion it could be the same
conversation maybe even in the same
sentence
they will contradict themselves and then
they will convince you that they haven&#39;t
done so because the more they get you
defending yourself the the more you&#39;re
going to believe that you need to be on
the defensive there&#39;s a concept that&#39;s
often used in sales it&#39;s called a yes
letter once you can get somebody to say
yes once to something really really
simple like a phone call if you can get
somebody to willingly say yes and want
to do something then the idea is that
it&#39;s easier and easier to get them to
say yes you build up to your big ask
now this conversational confusion is
kind of like that so the emotionally
abusive person uses misdirection and
they use all these techniques they use
word salad to get you to doubt yourself
within the conversation to get you to
doubt that you even can follow the
conversation and that you even know what
you&#39;re talking about
so if you can&#39;t follow the conversation
and you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re
talking about then how could you know
this other thing that this person is
trying to keep from you if you can doubt
one little thing and then another thing
and then another thing they&#39;ll just keep
going and they&#39;ll keep building the
confusion until you finally doubt the
big thing so as I&#39;ve kind of touched on
before there are so many different
layers to gaslighting and it&#39;s really an
insidious tactic if it&#39;s awful because
this is the big component that gets you
to question your your sanity and your
your ability to make decisions and this
eats away at your your sense of self and
your self-esteem and it makes you feel
like you need to be dependent on someone
in order to make decisions or to do
anything and gaslighting it can be very
very obvious in your face like again the
example I wear I saw you do this and
then the person says well no no that&#39;s
not what you saw you didn&#39;t see that at
all where they&#39;re just blatantly lying
to your face or it can be very subtle
like with the word salad technique where
they&#39;re just trying to confuse you and
often you&#39;ll experience all these layers
within the same relationship so if
you&#39;ve experienced gas lighting in your
relationship or in any relationship over
a period of time you&#39;re likely to
exhibit one or more of these signs so
first you always doubt yourself and that
just comes naturally with being with
somebody who&#39;s constantly making you
question your perception of reality this
second is that you&#39;re excusing your
partner&#39;s behavior and there are a few
reasons why this happens in emotionally
abusive relationships and gaslighting
it&#39;s a big one because not only are you
being gaslighted about the little things
that are going on on the day to day or
even the big things but this person is
also gaslighting you about the the
entirety of it about the idea that it&#39;s
abuse so you&#39;ve questioned your
perception of reality for so long on so
many different things on so many
different levels that it&#39;s difficult for
you to say well this person was abusive
towards me when you&#39;ve experienced
gaslighting over an extended period of
time you&#39;re more likely to believe the
reality that someone else is feeding you
so when you talk to other people you&#39;re
very likely to hide the more abusive
things that this person has done because
you know it will change the other
person&#39;s perception of the abuser and
this is a pretty clear sign that there
is gaslighting going on one of the
reasons why sharing this information
would change someone&#39;s perception of the
abusive person is because the abusive
person&#39;s reality that you&#39;ve accepted
doesn&#39;t hold up in actual reality
so when you tell somebody what&#39;s going
on and even if you use all of the
excuses and and all of the the logic and
the reasoning that the abusive person
has that you and maybe you have even
accepted it as truth it&#39;s not going to
hold up in real reality when someone
else hears it they&#39;re going to see it
for what it what did it and I can tell
you in my own experience that this was
100% true for me I knew I I did not talk
about a lot of things that were going on
and when I finally did when I finally
talked about the more abusive things
that had happened and at the time I
wasn&#39;t labeling it as abuse I couldn&#39;t
but everyone I talk to dick everyone I
talk to you when I finally got it out
there literally every person I talked to
you said Christina that&#39;s emotional
abuse and I&#39;m talking about all
different types of people and you know
different conversations and me trying to
give the other person the benefit of the
doubt yeah but I this and and yeah but
here&#39;s the background situation much to
my surprise everyone else saw what I
didn&#39;t see so a third sign that someone
is using gaslighting against you is that
you lack self-confidence you just you
feel like you can&#39;t make decisions on
your own
and the final sign that you are being
gaslighted is that you just don&#39;t have
the self-love that you did when you
first encountered this person or if it&#39;s
somebody you&#39;ve known all your life
you&#39;re just you&#39;re struggling with
self-love and you have a really negative
self-image that you can&#39;t seem to shake
so how to start overcoming the
gaslighting you&#39;ve experienced first and
foremost is to distance yourself from
the emotionally abusive person who has
been gaslighting you so this means going
no-contact or gray rock I mentioned
earlier that not everyone who uses
gaslighting is and are sociopaths
Psychopaths or even a chronically
abusive
person but if you notice a pattern and
if you&#39;re here I&#39;m guessing you do it&#39;s
time to start distancing yourself from
the person who&#39;s abusing you so that you
can heal the second thing you can do is
start talking about what&#39;s happening or
what has happened and if you can talk to
a professional counselor somebody who
has experience with emotional abuse
another thing you can do is become aware
of your own self-talk
so how do you talk about yourself to
other people and in your own head so are
you in a place where if you do something
that you&#39;re not really happy about you
might say oh I&#39;m so stupid I&#39;m such an
idiot and that&#39;s a common thing that a
lot of people in our society say but
just become aware of it because that&#39;s
not productive and it&#39;s not going to
help you build up your sense of
self-esteem another thing that&#39;s
important to do after you&#39;ve realized
that you&#39;ve encountered gaslighting is
to set boundaries with the person who
was gaslighting you super important and
it&#39;s also an important part of
distancing yourself from this person
so no contact or gray rock boundaries
are super super important so if you
